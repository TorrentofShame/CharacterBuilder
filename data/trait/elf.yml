  description: >
    Elves don't need to sleep. Instead they meditate deeply,
    remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
    While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are
    actually mental excercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.
    After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8
    hours of sleep.
